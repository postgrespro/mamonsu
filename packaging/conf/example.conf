# This plugin allows detects possible memory leaks while working with PostgreSQL using /proc/pid/status and /proc/pid/statm
# We use RES and SHR difference to calculate approximate volume of private anonymous backend memory.
# If it exceeds private_anon_mem_threshold then that pid will be added to a message. An example is presented below
# statm -  'pid: {pid},  RES {RES} - SHR {SHR} more then {private_anon_mem_threshold}\n'
# Since Linux 4.5 RssAnon, RssFile and RssShmem have been added.
# They allows to distinguish types of memory such as private anonymous, file-backed, and shared anonymous memory.
# We are interested in RssAnon. If its value exceeds private_anon_mem_threshold then that pid will also be added to a message.
# By default this plugin disabled. To enable this plugin - set bellow "enabled = False"
# #interval - (onitoring frequency in seconds. 60 seconds by default
